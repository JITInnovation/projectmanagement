# Technology Stack

This document outlines the technology stack for the Project & Resource Management System.

## 1. Frontend

-   **Framework:** ReactJS
    -   **Description:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It allows for the creation of reusable UI components and provides a highly responsive and dynamic user experience.
    -   **Reasoning:** React's component-based architecture is ideal for building a modular and maintainable single-page application (SPA). Its large ecosystem and community support will accelerate development.
-   **UI Framework:** Bootstrap
    -   **Description:** A popular CSS framework for developing responsive and mobile-first websites.
    -   **Reasoning:** Bootstrap provides a set of pre-built components and a responsive grid system, which will help in creating a consistent and professional-looking UI with less effort. It can be easily integrated with React using libraries like `react-bootstrap`.

## 2. Backend

-   **Framework:** Python with Django
    -   **Description:** A high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design.
    -   **Reasoning:** Django's "batteries-included" philosophy provides built-in features for authentication, an admin interface, and an ORM, which will significantly speed up the development of the backend API and business logic. Python is a robust language with excellent support for data handling.

## 3. Database

-   **System:** MySQL
    -   **Description:** A popular open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).
    -   **Reasoning:** MySQL is a reliable, well-documented, and widely-used database that is well-suited for structured data like users, projects, and timesheets. It integrates seamlessly with Django.

## 4. Database Schema Management

-   **Tool:** Django Migrations
    -   **Description:** Django's built-in database migration system that handles database schema changes and version control as Python code.
    -   **Reasoning:** As we're using Django as our backend framework, using Django Migrations provides a tightly integrated solution for managing database schema changes. It allows us to version control our database schema alongside our application code, ensuring that database changes are automated, repeatable, and consistent across all environments. The migrations are written in Python, making them easy to understand and maintain within our codebase.
